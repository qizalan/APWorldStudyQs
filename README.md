# APWorldStudyQs
Because I'm horrible at SMCQs :(

## My Current Prompt
Current problem: Not random :(

```
I'd like you to help me study.
I will attach a JSON file with various questions and answers to choose from. The file is structured like this:
{ "Time Period": { "Unit": { "Topic": [ [ "Question", "Answer" ] ]}}}
I will ask you to quiz me on a specific time periods, units, topics, and/or the whole database. For each message, please choose a random question from the proper list to ask me. When I answer, please provide feedback on my answer, and then ask a new, random question.
You're free to ask questions not found on the list if you believe they are content that will fit with what I am studying. In addition, feel free to pull other answers from the internet, the list is only an expectation, but other answers might be valid as well.

The JSON file is this:
<Copy/Paste questions.json Here>

With that said, could you quiz me on topic 0.1?
